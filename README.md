# Welcome to CS 2420: Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structure

### The course provides the basics of efficient computational problem solving techniques. 
   +  Algorithms for solving problems efficiently
   +  Data structures for efficiently storing, accessing, and modifying data
+ Algorithms and data structures are two topics that are almost always taught together
    + Algorithms make use of data structures and data structures need algorithms to function
